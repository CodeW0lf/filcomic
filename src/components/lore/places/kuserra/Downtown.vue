    <h2>Downtown</h2>
    <p>
      In the heart of Redtail territory, Kuserra's "Downtown" is the prime
      location for residences and shops. If it can be bought in Kuserra, chances
      are pretty good that someone is selling it here. The region spans nearly
      two dozen city blocks, and has hundreds of market stalls lining its
      criss-crossing streets. A lot of work has gone into reclaiming the region
      from the ruins. Debris has been cleared from main paths, roads and
      walkways have been flattened, structures have been built or reinforced to
      prevent collapse, and many interior spaces have been cleaned out and
      turned into comfortable dwellings for those willing and able to pay for
      them.

      The Downtown is close to where most caravans come to the city to trade, so
      the merchants who are fortunate enough to keep up with their taxes also
      get first pick of the cheap bulk goods and supplies brought into the city
      from across the Deadlands. The security and upkeep of this area is
      priority one for the Redtail gang, and it is protected by regular patrols
      that enforce a strict Zero-Tolerance Violence policy -- albeit any way
      they choose to enforce it.

      In addition to several market strips, the Downtown also includes many
      other notable locations, such as Betty's grocery, the Redtail's casino,
      Twitchâ€™s bank, the Tail Twirl club, and the Upside Bar, among others. The
      density and relative safety of the Downtown area attracts a lot of people,
      though at night, most of them return home to the far cheaper slums that
      surround the region.
